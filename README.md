Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

In this sqlalchemy challenge. I am tasked to analyse: 

Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

Connect to the Database and Reflect Tables

Use create_engine() from SQLAlchemy to connect to the SQLite database.
Use automap_base() to reflect tables into classes, and save references to the classes named station and measurement.
Perform Precipitation Analysis

Find the most recent date in the dataset.
Retrieve the previous 12 months of precipitation data using a query.
Select only the "date" and "prcp" values.
Load query results into a Pandas DataFrame, setting column names.
Sort DataFrame values by "date".
Plot the results using DataFrame plot method.
Print summary statistics for the precipitation data.
Perform Station Analysis

Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.
List the stations and observation counts in descending order.
Identify the station with the greatest number of observations.
Calculate lowest, highest, and average temperatures for the most-active station.
Query the previous 12 months of temperature observation (TOBS) data for the most-active station.
Plot the results as a histogram with bins=12.
Close the Session

Part 2: Design Your Climate App

Create Flask Routes

Create the routes /, /api/v1.0/precipitation, /api/v1.0/stations, /api/v1.0/tobs, /api/v1.0/<start>, and /api/v1.0/<start>/<end>.
Define Route Functions

Define functions for each route to perform the required queries.
For example, for /api/v1.0/precipitation, you would convert the query results to a dictionary and return a JSON representation.
For /api/v1.0/stations, you would query and return a JSON list of stations.
Return JSON Responses

Use the jsonify function from Flask to convert your data into valid JSON responses for each route.
